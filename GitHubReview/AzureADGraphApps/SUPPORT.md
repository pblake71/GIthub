## How to file issues and request help

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests:

1. Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureADGraphApps/issues) before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.
2. If you don't find an issue that matches yours, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.
